## General Guidelines

* Focus on "why" and not "how" in documentation.
* Test all return values for errors.
* Use `const` for variables that are not reassigned.
* Use short, imperative commit messages.
* Separate unrelated changes into distinct commits.
* Whenever possible, separate logic from dependencies or interfaces such that logic can be unit tested.
